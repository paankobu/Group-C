PROJECT OVERVIEW




IMPLEMENTING THE PROJECT PLAN

Deliverables:

Hardware Requirement: For the hardware, our company requires the usage of standard computer that be able to consistently run the spam filter therefore computer part will consist of 8 Gb ram and intel core i5.

Software Requirement:

Software Requirement: Our company mainly utilized python programming language as the main language to develop intelligent module in filtering spam and content. Other than that, our main software graphical operating system to develop and create all the documents and algorithm related to this project.

Intelligent System Architecture:

The proposed neural network is Logistic Regression. This is because the model is dealing with binary output which is either spam or non-spam. Therefore logistic regression is the most suitable and simple for the project to attune and transform.

Outcome Of the System:

2 Main Steps will be processed throughout the system, which is content and spam identifying through the neural network training phase, spam criteria and recognition performance through the testing phase. Provided with the dataset comprises of email data which label as spam and non-spam(ham), the model utilized logistic regression to attune the graph transformation to fit the best line on the model that can accurately predict the spam email. After that, the model will be tested to determine the model performance against testing dataset and displaying the information such as Confusion Matrix and recall and accuracy score.
