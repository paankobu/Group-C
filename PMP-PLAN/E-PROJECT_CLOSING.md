3.0 Final Project Report 


Spam Detection in Email Using Machine Learning

1.0	 PROJECT OBJECTIVES

The Spam Detection in Email Using Machine Learning done by the KFT Inc. was intended to develop an artificial intelligence system that able to detect spam from the email. Besides, one of the aims of Company is to develop a system that are able to recognize the characteristics of key spam words. Not only that, but we also intend to build and web-based application programming interface for future ease of use as the integration module.

2.0 SUMMARY OF PROJECTS RESULTS

After the system has been completed, we tested the accuracy of the system. The system has an accuracy of 65%

3.0 ORIGINAL AND ACTUAL SCHEDULE

The projects members mostly stick to the Gantt Chart scheduled so the actual progress fits the original schedule with exception in the designing phases where we are slightly late than expected by a day.

4.0 ORIGINAL AND ACTUAL BUDGET

The actual budget mostly matches the original budget, which means that the team has followed the budget planned at the beginning of the project and does not use any excessive money with the exception being in the indirect cost mainly in the server maintenances.

5.0 PROJECT ASSESSMENT

5.1 SCOPE

The project scope was initiated from the beginning of the project. For instance, there isnâ€™t publicly easy for any user to utilize any third-party spam filtering. Most of the spam filtering services comes mostly within other services restricting its usage outside of environment. So, the system will build upon on the web-services so any user can utilize it. Not only that, but the spam filtering also only works on email that uses English language as the main mode of communication. Therefore, the projects limit down to scope to identify English alphabets and number character. Therefore, this system cannot be used when another language embedded in the email.

5.2 OBJECTIVES

KFT Inc. managed to achieve the objectives initialized since the beginning of the projects. A system that is artificial intelligence powered, which utilized machine learning technique has been made. Machine learning is used on this project to identify which words contributed to the email being spam and non-spam. Besides, the algorithm is also imbedded into the web-services allowing one of the criteria of the project to be met.

5.3 IMPACTS

By creating this system, the accessibility of the user to determine whether their selected email is spam or not have been increased twofold. This accessibility allows the user to independently filter their email and any written mail easily without necessarily relying on pre-built services such as Gmail or outlook. Not only that, any company wanted to utilize the system for their own purpose to built it into their own services can also be done and plucked straight from our system. This allows independent party or company to our services without any difficulties since they are dealing in a same vein as the third-party company.

6.0 TRANSITION PLAN

KFT Inc. staff will provide support when require. The main work of support provided by KFT Inc. staff on the Spam Filter recognition system projects are as shown below:
  i)	Maintain the system.
  ii)	Handling errors and updates of the system.
  iii)	Provide user guidelines for ASD staff to use the system.
  iv)	Report information to senior management on monthly basis.
