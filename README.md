# SPAM EMAIL DETECTION IN EMAIL USING MACHINE LEARNING

This is a project that detect and recognize number plate of car. This project use Artificial Intelligence(AI) technique such as Machine Learning and Neural Network(NN).

The project is developed by following Project Management Plan(PMP) to better organized the lifecycle of the project. Several charting techniques such as Gantt Chart, Milestone Chart, Work Breakdown Structure(WBS) is used to manage the project.

The PMP-Plan developed to simulate collaboration between third party organization.

Project Execution is the execution phase where the result, coding blocks and technical implementation is defined and documented.

PROJECT CLOSING 

https://github.com/paankobu/Group-C/blob/fa967cef29d8d269bf955784590322fc0bbb2f30/PMP-PLAN/E-PROJECT_CLOSING.md

Project Closing indicate the end of the project lifecycle where the project need to document closing document and lesson learnt report.
